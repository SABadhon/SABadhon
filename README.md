I am an undergraduate student, currently doing my Bachelor in Science - BS, on Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), one of the most reputed universities of Bangladesh. I am a huge geek/nerd and love to read books a lot. Also I have a passion for exploring and learning new things that interests me. I can code in several languages across different platforms. Love traveling, playing indoor and outdoor games.
